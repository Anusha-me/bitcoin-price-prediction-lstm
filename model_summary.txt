ðŸ§  LSTM Model Summary â€“ Bitcoin Price Forecasting

> ðŸ“Œ This repository focuses on Bitcoin price forecasting from a stock market perspective using LSTM, covering the period **2017â€“2024**.  
> A separate version treating Bitcoin as a **currency** will be provided in a future repository.

ðŸ“¦ Model Architecture:

- Input Shape: (60, 1)  â†’ sequences of 60 daily prices
- ðŸ§© Layer 1: LSTM (tunable units: 32â€“128), return_sequences=True
- ðŸ”½ Dropout (tunable rate: 0.1â€“0.5)
- ðŸ§© Layer 2: LSTM (same unit config), return_sequences=False
- ðŸ”½ Dropout (same rate)
- ðŸ”¢ Dense Layer: (tunable units: 16â€“64), ReLU activation
- ðŸŽ¯ Output Layer: Dense(1) â†’ predicted price

ðŸ›  Tunable Hyperparameters:

- `lstm_units`: [32, 64, 96, 128]
- `dropout_rate`: [0.1 to 0.5]
- `dense_units`: [16, 32, 48, 64]
- `learning_rate`: [0.0001 to 0.01] (log scale)

ðŸ§ª Loss Function:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)

ðŸš€ Optimizer:
- Adam (tunable learning rate)

ðŸŽ¯ Target:
- Predict the next day's Bitcoin price in USD

---

ðŸ”— Real-time Integration:
- Fetches live Bitcoin price using CoinGecko API (used in validation or to compare with predictions)

ðŸ“Š Sequence Length Used:
- 60-day window to predict the 61st value

This architecture is designed to balance complexity and generalization by using dropout, sequence-aware layers, and flexible hyperparameter search via KerasTuner.
